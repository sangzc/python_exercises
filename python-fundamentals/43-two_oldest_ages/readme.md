Write a function called two_oldest_ages. The function should take a list of numbers as its argument and return the two highest numbers within the list. The returned value should be a list in the format [second oldest age, oldest age].

The order of the numbers passed in could be any order.

Examples

```py
two_oldest_ages([1, 2, 10, 8]) # [8, 10]
two_oldest_ages([6, 1, 9, 10, 4]) # [9, 10]
two_oldest_ages([4, 25, 3, 20, 19, 5]) # [20, 25]
```
