Write a function called two_list_dictionary which accepts two lists of varying lengths.

The first list consists of keys and the second one consists of values.

Your function should return a dictionary created from the keys and values. If there are not enough values, the remaining keys should have a value of None.

If there not enough keys, just ignore the remaining values.
