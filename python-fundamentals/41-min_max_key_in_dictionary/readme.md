Write a function called min_max_key_in_dictionary which returns a list with the lowest key in the dictionary and the highest key in the dictionary.

You can assume that the dictionary will have keys that are numbers.

Examples

```py
min_max_key_in_dictionary({
  2: 'a', 7: 'b', 1: 'c', 10: 'd', 4: 'e'
}) # [1, 10]

min_max_key_in_dictionary({
  1: "Elie", 4: "Matt", 3: "Tim"
}) # [1, 4]
```
