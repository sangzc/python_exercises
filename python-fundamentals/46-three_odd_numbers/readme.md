Write a function called three_odd_numbers, which accepts a list of numbers and returns True if any three consecutive numbers sum to an odd number.

Examples

```py
three_odd_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) # True
three_odd_numbers([0, -2, 4, 1, 9, 12, 4, 1, 0]) # True
three_odd_numbers([5, 2, 1]) # False
three_odd_numbers([1, 2, 3, 3, 2]) # False
```
