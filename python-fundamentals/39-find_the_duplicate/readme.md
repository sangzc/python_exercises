Write a function called find_the_duplicate which accepts a list of numbers that contains at most a single duplicate. The function returns the number which is a duplicate, or None if there are no duplicates.

Examples

```py
find_the_duplicate([1, 2, 1, 4, 3, 12]) # 1
find_the_duplicate([6, 1, 9, 5, 3, 4, 9]) # 9
find_the_duplicate([2, 1, 3, 4]) # None
```
