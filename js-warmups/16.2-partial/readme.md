Partial application refers to the process of taking a function and returning a new function until all parameters to that function have been passed. The function that is partially applied, eventually resolves with a value once all parameters have been passed to it.

Here’s a basic example of how you’d use it:

```js
function add(a, b, c) {
  return a + b + c;
}

var partialAdd = partial(add);

partialAdd(1)()()()(2, 3); // 6
```

Hint - you will need to use closure as well as the length property on functions to solve this problem. The length property on functions allows you to see how many parameters a function accepts.
Here are the test cases:

```js
function addAlot(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h) {
  return a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h;
}

var partialAdd = partial(addAlot);

partialAdd()(1, 2)(3, 4)(5, 6)()()()()(6)()()(10, 11, 12); // 37

function subtractAlot(a, b, c, d, e) {
  return a - b - c - d - e;
}

var partialSub = partial(subtractAlot);

partialSub(1, 2, 3)(4, 5, 6); // -13
```
