Write a function called sameFrequency. Given two positive integers, find out if the two numbers have the same frequency of digits.

Your solution MUST have the following complexities:

Time: O(N + M), where N is the number of digits in the first number, and M is the number of digits in the second number.

Sample Input:

```js
sameFrequency(182, 281); // true
sameFrequency(34, 14); // false
sameFrequency(3589578, 5879385); // true
sameFrequency(22, 222); // false
```
