Write a recursive function called alternateSign, which alternates the numbers in an array between positive and negative regardless of their original sign. The first number in the index should always be positive.

```js
alternateSign([2, 7, 8, 3, 1, 4]);
// --> [2, -7, 8, -3, 1, -4]

alternateSign([-2, -7, 8, 3, -1, 4]);
// --> [2, -7, 8, -3, 1, -4]
```
