Write a recursive function called numToText, which accepts a string and returns a string with digits converted to their word equivalent.

Assume all numbers are single digits (less than 10) and greater than 0.

```js
numToText("My 2 favorite numbers are 4 and 1");
// "My two favorite numbers are four and one"

numToText("I have 5 dogs and 6 ponies");
// "I have five dogs and six ponies"
```
