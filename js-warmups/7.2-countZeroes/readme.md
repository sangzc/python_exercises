Given an array of 1s and 0s which has all 1s first followed by all 0s, write a function called countZeroes, which returns the number of zeroes in the array.

```js
countZeroes([1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]); // 2
countZeroes([1, 0, 0, 0, 0]); // 4
countZeroes([0, 0, 0]); // 3
countZeroes([1, 1, 1, 1]); // 0
```

Time Complexity - O(log n)
